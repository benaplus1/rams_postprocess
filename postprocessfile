Do you want to process Analysis files or Lite files? Enter *L* for Lite, *A* for Analysis
A

Type of vertical coordinates to use: Cartesian coordinates, Pressure coordinates, or Sigma coordinates
Cartesian

If using cartesian or sigma interpolation, the maximum altitude (in meters) you'd like to include in post-processing. leave blank to analyze the whole grid
10000

If using pressure interpolation, the pressure levels in hPa you'd like the post-processed data on as comma-separated values
1000, 950, 925, 900, 850, 700, 500
Analysis start time in YYYY-mm-dd-HHMMSS format
2010-01-02-060000

Analysis end time in YYYY-mm-dd-HHMMSS format
2010-01-02-080000

Grid Number to post-process
1

List of RAMS variables you'd like to process, as comma-separated entries. Put *all* to process all available variables
UC,VC,WC,RTP,RV,PI,THETA,TOPT,PATCH,SFLUX_R,SFLUX_T,RCP,RRP,RPP,RSP,RAP,LATHEATFRZT,LATHEATVAPT,PATCH_AREA,LEAF_CLASS,SFCWATER_MASS,SFCWATER_DEPTH,VEG_TEMP,CAN_RVAP,CAN_RVAP,PCPRS,PCPRA,PCPRP,PCPRR,ACCPP,ACCPS,ACCPA,ACCPR,RSHORT,RLONG,RLONGUP,ALBEDT

Use the *RAMS* variable names, or *verbose* variable names in post-processed NetCDF files?
verbose

List of derived variables you'd like to output, as comma-separated entries (a full list of available derived variables is avilable in comments at the top of derivedvars.py). Leave blank to not output any derived quantities. Enter *all* to output all derived quantities available for your output file. Enter *nomomentum* to output all variables except momentum budgets, which are quite slow to calculate
Temperature,Pressure,SrfPres,SrfTemp,MSLP,MSLT,IceMix,LiqMix,ThetaV,ThetaRho,TempV,TempRho,Rho,VaporPressure,PWAT,Dewpoint,CloudTopHeight,CloudBaseHeight,CloudTopPressure,CloudBasePressure,LiqSatFrac,IceSatFrac,VertIntIce

If outputting momentum budgets, the number of Y grid points used for horizontal averaging
20

If outputting momentum budgets, the number of X grid points used for horizontal averaging
20

If outputting momentum budgets, the type of convolution kernel used for horizontal averaging (documentation is available in derivedvars.py)
trikernel
